# TODO:
* ~~make it so that the board updates in real time instead of appearing multiple times in the console.~~
* make it so that i can choose the card with arrow keys instead of it being a 1-20 choice
* ~~add colors to make it pretty and easier to read~~
* maybe update the UI whenever i'll learn how to do that
* add difficulties? easy being 20 cards, medium being 30 and so on
